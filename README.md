# PHPFeedProxy

Easy RSS to Json proxy for PHP.

After Google shut down the RSS to Json conversion engine the only easy options were to use Yahoo's or roll your own.  I tried Yahoo's for a while, but it just didn't cut it, so I switched to a roll-your-own method and this is the first pass at the result.
